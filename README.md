Designed to be balanced but with the intention of making past the first quota, there is bigger lobby sizes as well as people being able to join late. Discord presence has been added with the added feature of being able to join your friends games with it (I haven't actually tested this yet). All monsters have had their AI tweaked, and theres a lot of new custom items, suits and scrap to collect as well as buyable emotes to flex on your friends. Some moons have custom dungeons, Titan has an [REDACTED] ;) and theres a custom dungeon active on any moon.
